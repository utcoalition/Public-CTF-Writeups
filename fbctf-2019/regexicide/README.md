I finally figured out the passphrase to the EVIL club. It's pretty complicated so I've decided to store it in my server in case I forget.
I've protected it with a password though, so it's virtually impossible for anyone else to get it. I sometimes accidentally enter my
password multiple times, so I added a twist to my server to handle that case too.
For some reason my server gets bloated after a while - nothing frequent deploys can't fix.

## Solution:

For this problem we found that port 9001 was open. After looking at the webpage we realize that this was HHVM with the [admin server](https://hhvm.com/blog/521/the-adminserver) exposed and unauthenticated. 
Looking at the different options available to us on the admin page this section seemed particularly promising:
```
/static-strings:  get number of static strings
/static-strings-rds: ... that correspond to defined constants
/dump-static-strings: dump static strings to /tmp/static_strings
/random-static-strings: return randomly selected static strings
   count         number of strings to return, default 1
```

We can query `http://34.212.86.199/static-strings` to retrieve the number of static strings. Then, we can query `http://34.212.86.199/random-static-strings?count=num` in order to retreive all static strings in the application. The flag can be found with a quick search for `fb{`.
